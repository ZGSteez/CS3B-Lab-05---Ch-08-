Program Design 8.7
Input:
In detail indicate what the inputs to this program are?
	String barCode - String of lines and dots to simulate bar codes
	int zipCode - integers that simulate a ZIP code
	
How do you validate the input
	The input is validated through the errorChecker method
Pseudocode: Briefly explain how this section will look like – Each module should have its own section.
	errorChecker()
	{
		Check if multiple of 10
	}
Processing
What is this program calculating?
	This program is calculating user inputs of either zip code or bar codes and converting them to bar codes and zip codes respectively. 
Can we divide the calculations to the smaller “modules”
	Yes, the program is separated into the two main methods of conversion.
Pseudocode: Briefly explain how this section will look like – Each module should have its own section.
public int getZipCode(String barCode)
{
	convert barcode into zip code
}
	public String getBarCode(int zipCode)
{
		convert zip code into barcode
	]

Output
What will this program display to the users?
This program will display either a corresponding bar code with their zip code input or this program will display a corresponding zip code to their bar code.
What kind of formatting this output will use (Currency with $ …)?
This formatting the output will use strings of vertical lines and dots to represent a bar code and the zip code is normal integers.
Pseudocode: Briefly explain how this section will look like
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			print getzipcode(“|:||:::|”);
			print getBarCode(91102);		
}
Library
What Libraries do you need for this program?
	
Initialization and constant variables
What variables need to be initialized?
String[] BarCodes - array of strings, where each string represents a section of a bar code
	checkSumErrorFound - initialized to true, and changed if error is found
What variables need to be defined as constant
	String[] BarCodes - array of strings this needs to be constant since methods should just refer to this and it should not be changed
