//    Simulate a car sharing system in which car commuters pick up and drop off passengers
//        at designated stations. Assume that there are 30 such stations, one at every mile
//        along a route. At each station, randomly generate a number of cars and passengers,
//        each of them with a desired target station.
//        Each driver picks up three random passengers whose destination is on the way to the
//        carâ€™s destination, drops them off where requested, and picks up more if possible. A
//        driver gets paid per passenger per mile. Run the simulation 1,000 times and report
//        the average revenue per mile.
//        Use classes Car, Passenger, Station, and Simulation in your solution.
